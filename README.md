Walk with me through the california housing prices dataset!
Let's take a look at the data with some matplotlib plots, investigate the distribution of data
And develop some Linear Regression Models!

In the process, we'll cover
    stochastic gradient decent
    batch gradient decent
    mini batch gradient decent
    
Let's then predict the housing prices in the next 50 years :)
